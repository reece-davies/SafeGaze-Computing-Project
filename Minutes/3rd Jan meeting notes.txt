Ordered new hardware (capture device) - researched it and got it working with livestreaming directly to youtube

Started working on livestream functionality (confusing and tedious)
	- Facility livestream page: create new livestream + view their livestreams
							    ^ later connected to DB

	- Member's functionality for livestreams (access times, etc)

Also added a lot of screenshots of the development process. Would these be useful in the report and what would be best practise for this?
	- Keep hold of critical screenshots
	- Put other ones in the appendix

YouTube or other private streaming service
	- Can use YouTube as a "viable proof of concept"
	- State how this can grow (conclusions, limitations, future work, ammendments)

Next steps:
	- Added functionality
	- Decide method of approach for livestream
	- Do more work on report + general things stated in the meeting earlier today (showcase material planning)
