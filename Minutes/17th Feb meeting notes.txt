Finished all main functionality
	- Tasks all over the place at the moment (lots of little ones)
Important but not functional requirements
	- Styling aspects
	- Logo
Done a decent amount of work on report (would like it to be a little more - but I do have useful notes)
Sent a video demonstration to my client (Exeter Trampoline Academy) - awaiting response (NOT SHOWCASE)

Started planning showcase materials
Started with "Getting started" guide (pretty important)
