SafeGaze is a web app that is directed towards the physical safety and cybersecurity of sports clubs and facilities. It focusses on providing a safe streaming platform for a facility’s members, and thus negates the risk of stalking or harassment of strangers and its members, especially when the participants primarily consist of children. By implementing this system, facilities will be able to create a secure livestreaming platform which allows their members to safely watch their children taking part in such activities. 

Additionally, in light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, most designated viewing areas in sports facilities have been closed, or severely limited in an effort to comply with social distancing rules. SafeGaze would nullify the need for these viewing areas, as parents will be able to watch their children remotely via one or numerous livestreams. Furthermore, facilities will be able to use the app as an administrator tool to manage their club’s members and livestreams, as well as issue important notifications or messages to its members. The business will be able to control which members have a SafeGaze account that is linked to said facility, alongside with what times each specific user has access to these livestreams, therefore improving the facility’s overall security.
